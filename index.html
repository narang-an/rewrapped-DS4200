      <p>
        Music is an integral part of our daily lives, and it can reflect our
        moods, routines, and cultural influences. With streaming platforms like
        Spotify, music consumption has become more accessible and personalized
        than ever. These platforms generate vast amounts of data that reveal
        individual listening habits, including top genres, favorite artists, and
        frequently played songs. Analyzing this data can reveal unique patterns,
        highlighting both shared and distinct musical preferences among users.
        This project aims to build on that idea by creating a personalized
        Spotify Wrapped experience. Given its popularity, our goal is to develop
        our own version using the Spotify API, which can offer users deeper
        insights into their listening habits. By leveraging this data, we can
        uncover intriguing patterns and trends, providing an engaging way for
        users to interact with their music statistics.

            Hi! I’m Diya, a combined Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience
            student at Northeastern University! I’m very interested in this
            project because I love music and am an avid concert-goer (I’ve been
            to 3 in the past month!) I love discovering new music and getting
            recommendations from peers, so seeing other students’ favorite songs
            was really cool to me.

            Hello, I'm Anusha, a Computer Science student at Northeastern. I'm
            interested in exploring how data can reveal patterns in human
            behavior, and music is a fascinating way to study this.
