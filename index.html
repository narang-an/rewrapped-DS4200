        <p>Music plays a central role in our everyday lives, often reflecting our moods, routines, and cultural influences. For our project, we focused specifically on people’s favorite songs and explored a Spotify dataset to uncover interesting trends and patterns within that data. Rather than building a personalized experience, we created a collection of visualizations to analyze different aspects of these top tracks, from word clouds of song titles to scatterplots comparing song popularity with musical features. Our website, Spotify ReWrapped, showcases these interactive graphs, offering insights into characteristics like key distribution, time signatures, and average song duration, all through the lens of users’ most-loved music.

        <h2>Introduction to the Dataset</h2>
      </section>

        <p>
           This dataset contains information on 101 Spotify tracks, capturing a wide range of musical and metadata features. Each row represents a single song and includes details such as the track and album name, artist, release date, and record label. The dataset also features a variety of musical attributes commonly used in audio analysis, including:
* Duration (ms) – Length of the song in milliseconds
* Popularity – A score from Spotify reflecting how popular the track is
* Danceability, Energy, Valence, and Acousticness – Quantitative indicators of a song’s feel and mood
* Key and Mode – Musical key and whether it's major (1) or minor (0)
* Speechiness, Instrumentalness, and Liveness – Metrics describing the audio’s spoken word content, instrumental quality, and live performance feel
* Tempo – Beats per minute (BPM)
* Time Signature – Rhythmic structure of the song
Overall, this dataset offers a compact yet insightful glimpse into the characteristics of music on Spotify. With a combination of musical attributes, popularity metrics, and metadata like artist and release information, it allows for a wide range of analyses from, identifying patterns in song structure to exploring what makes a track popular.

                <p>Hi! I’m Diya, a combined Data Science and Behavioral Neuroscience student at Northeastern University! 
                    I’m very interested in this project because I love music and am an avid concert-goer 
                    (I’ve been to 3 in the past month!) I love discovering new music and getting recommendations from peers, 
                    so seeing other students’ favorite songs was really cool to me.</p>

                    Hello, I'm Anusha, a Computer Science student at Northeastern. I'm
                    interested in exploring how data can reveal patterns in human
                    behavior, and music is a fascinating way to study this.

                <p>Hey! I’m Carissa, a student at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Business (Finance). 
                    I’m very interested in this project because I recently started DJing and love exploring different genres and 
                    trends in music. Understanding what people listen to and how their tastes evolve is fascinating to me, 
                    especially when it comes to making sets for different audience.</p>
