        <p>Music is an integral part of our daily lives, and it can reflect our moods, routines, and cultural influences. With streaming platforms like Spotify, music consumption has become more accessible and personalized than ever. These platforms generate vast amounts of data that reveal individual listening habits, including top genres, favorite artists, and frequently played songs. Analyzing this data can reveal unique patterns, highlighting both shared and distinct musical preferences among users.
            This project aims to build on that idea by creating a personalized Spotify Wrapped experience. Given its popularity, our goal is to develop our own version using the Spotify API, which can offer users deeper insights into their listening habits. By leveraging this data, we can uncover intriguing patterns and trends, providing an engaging way for users to interact with  their music statistics.
