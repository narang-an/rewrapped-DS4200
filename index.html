      <p>
        Music plays a central role in our everyday lives, often reflecting our moods, routines, and cultural influences. 
        For our project, we focused specifically on people’s favorite songs and explored a Spotify dataset to uncover 
        interesting trends and patterns within that data. Rather than building a personalized experience, we created a 
        collection of visualizations to analyze different aspects of these top tracks, from word clouds of song titles to 
        scatterplots comparing song popularity with musical features. Our website, Spotify ReWrapped, showcases these 
        interactive graphs, offering insights into characteristics like key distribution, time signatures, and average song 
        duration, all through the lens of users’ most-loved music. We were inspired by the Spotify Wrapped experience, 
        and did some research on what makes Spotify Wrapped such a fun experience. Below are the references we looked at
        for inspiration:

        <h2>Introduction to the Dataset</h2>
      </section>
      <p>This dataset contains information on 101 Spotify tracks, capturing a wide range of musical and metadata features. Each row represents a single song and includes details such as the track and album name, artist, release date, and record label. The dataset also features a variety of musical attributes commonly used in audio analysis, including:
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <li>Duration (ms) – Length of the song in milliseconds</li>
            <li>Popularity – A score from Spotify reflecting how popular the track is</li>
            <li>Danceability, Energy, Valence, and Acousticness – Quantitative indicators of a song's feel and mood</li>
            <li>Key and Mode – Musical key and whether it's major (1) or minor (0)</li>
            <li>Speechiness, Instrumentalness, and Liveness – Metrics describing the audio's spoken word content, instrumental quality, and live performance feel</li>
            <li>Tempo – Beats per minute (BPM)</li>
            <li>Time Signature – Rhythmic structure of the song</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This dataset was joined with information collected from a survey conducted in our machine learning class, where students were asked to list their favorite songs. The survey responses were matched with corresponding attributes from this dataset, which were obtained from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/song-popularity-dataset" target="_blank">Song Popularity Dataset on Kaggle</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, this dataset offers a compact yet insightful glimpse into the characteristics of music on Spotify. With a combination of musical attributes, popularity metrics, and metadata like artist and release information, it allows for a wide range of analyses, from identifying patterns in song structure to exploring what makes a track popular.

        <h2>General Conclusions</h2>
    </section>

    <p>
        Our visualizations show that while some patterns emerge, musical taste is highly individual and shaped by a wide 
        range of factors.  
        <br>
        <br>
        One key finding is the recurring presence of themes in song titles. Words like "love" and "home" frequently 
        appear, reflecting common themes of emotion and nostalgia. This suggests that listeners are drawn to songs 
        that evoke connection, memory, and partnership. When examining musical keys, we see a clear preference for 
        major keys, particularly C, G♯/A♭, and D, which aligns with the upbeat sound of many popular songs. However, 
        minor keys also play a significant role, indicating that songs with more somber or introspective qualities still 
        resonate with audiences. The balance between major and minor modes shows that listeners appreciate a range of 
        emotional tones in their favorite music.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Attributes like energy, danceability, loudness, and tempo vary widely across popular songs. While some keys and 
        attributes are linked to higher energy or danceability, there’s no consistent pattern tying these characteristics 
        to popularity. This suggests that listeners’ preferences are shaped not just by specific traits but by a mix of 
        factors that create an emotional connection.  
        <br>
        <br>
        One noticeable trend is the change in song duration over the decades. While older songs were generally longer, 
        modern hits are shorter, likely due to changes in how we consume music, especially with the rise of streaming 
        platforms.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, our data visualizations show that musical preferences are complex, shaped by cultural trends and personal 
        taste. Although some patterns are evident, like the preference for major keys and shorter songs, individual choices 
        vary greatly, highlighting the diverse ways music resonates with listeners. In the future, it would be interesting 
        to see how these patterns change over time, as well as how they differ across different genres and cultures. We could
        ask the same group of people what their favorite song is every year and see how their tastes change over time.
