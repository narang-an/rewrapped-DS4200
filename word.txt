Design Explanation of Visualizations

LINEGRAPH — AVERAGE SONG DURATION OVER TIME:
The purpose of this visualization is to examine how average song duration has changed across decades. By plotting 
the average duration of tracks per decade in a line graph, we can easily identify trends over time. This approach 
reveals a gradual decline in song length through the mid-20th century, a sharp increase in the 1970s, which was likely 
influenced by experimental and progressive music, and a return to shorter formats in more recent decades. Highlighting 
these shifts helps us understand how musical styles, industry norms, and listening habits have evolved over the past century.


WORDCLOUD — MOST COMMON WORDS IN SONG TITLES:
The purpose of this visualization is to uncover common themes and ideas in song titles by highlighting the most frequently 
occurring words. This word cloud represents each word with a size proportional to its frequency, making it easy to spot 
trends at a glance. Larger words such as "OK," "remaster," "home," and "love" reflect recurring concepts related to emotion, 
nostalgia, and personal experience. By removing common stop words, the visualization focuses on more meaningful language, 
helping to reveal the cultural and thematic patterns embedded in popular music. Despite readability limits due to tool 
constraints, users can still explore the finer details using Plotly’s interactive zoom and pan features.


SCATTERPLOT — POPULARITY VS. VARIOUS METRICS:
The purpose of this visualization is to explore the relationship between song popularity and various musical attributes. 
Understanding what makes a song popular is a complex challenge, as musical taste is subjective. By analyzing attributes 
such as duration, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveliness, valence, and 
tempo, this visualization aims to uncover any patterns or correlations that might shed light on what listeners find 
appealing.

One of the primary motivations for creating this visualization was to challenge the assumption that specific musical 
features directly correlate with popularity. For instance, it might seem intuitive to think that more energetic or 
danceable songs would be more popular. However, the data reveals that there is no clear linear relationship between 
popularity and attributes like energy, danceability, or loudness. This suggests that while these characteristics may 
influence a song’s appeal, they do not single-handedly determine its success.


HEATMAP — VARIOUS FEATURES:
The purpose of this visualization is to explore patterns and relationships between different musical attributes using a 
dynamic heatmap. Users can select any combination of features for the x and y axes from a dropdown list of 10 variables, 
enabling 100 unique pairings. The color intensity indicates the number of songs that fall within specific value ranges, 
with darker shades representing higher concentrations. This setup makes it easy to identify common value ranges, such as 
energy levels between 0.5 and 0.6 or song durations between 200,000 and 300,000 milliseconds. When both axes are set to the 
same variable, the diagonal of the heatmap highlights the most representative range for that feature. This flexible, 
interactive format offers insights into the dataset’s typical characteristics and helps uncover correlations or clusters 
among audio features.


BARCHART — KEY VS. NUMBER OF SONGS:
The purpose of this visualization is to explore the distribution of songs across different musical keys and how they 
vary by major or minor mode. This stacked bar chart shows how frequently each key appears in the dataset, with color-coded 
sections distinguishing between major (blue) and minor (red) modes. By visualizing the data in this way, we can quickly 
compare the emotional tone of songs across keys, as major keys often evoke brightness and energy, while minor keys tend 
to convey deeper or more somber moods. This chart helps reveal which keys are most commonly used and how mood varies within 
musical compositions.


BARCHART — KEY VS. AVERAGE OF SELECTED METRIC:
The purpose of this visualization is to explore how musical key influences various song attributes. By presenting an 
interactive bar chart, we can examine the average values of attributes like duration, danceability, energy, and popularity 
across different keys. This dynamic approach allows us to quickly identify patterns such as which keys are associated with 
more energetic tracks or higher popularity. Dividing the data by key offers insights into how tonality may shape musical 
style/listener preferences.
