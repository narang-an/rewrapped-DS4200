The scatterplot of popularity vs. various features:
The purpose of this visualization is to explore the relationship between song popularity and various musical attributes. Understanding what makes a song popular is a complex challenge, as musical taste is subjective. By analyzing attributes such as duration, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveliness, valence, and tempo, this visualization aims to uncover any patterns or correlations that might shed light on what listeners find appealing.
One of the primary motivations for creating this visualization was to challenge the assumption that specific musical features directly correlate with popularity. For instance, it might seem intuitive to think that more energetic or danceable songs would be more popular. However, the data reveals that there is no clear linear relationship between popularity and attributes like energy, danceability, or loudness. This suggests that while these characteristics may influence a song’s appeal, they do not single-handedly determine its success.

The heatmap with a scatterplot overlaid of Dancibility vs. Tempo by Time Signature:
The purpose of this visualization is to examine the relationship between danceability and tempo in users' favorite songs while accounting for variations in time signature. Danceability and tempo are two fundamental attributes that often shape a song’s feel and appeal, but the way they interact is not always straightforward. By creating a heatmap with an overlaid scatterplot, this visualization allows us to explore whether there are any consistent patterns linking these two attributes. Additionally, filtering by time signature helps highlight how rhythmic structure influences danceability and tempo, revealing patterns that might be overlooked otherwise.

The barchart of key vs. the average of different attrubutes per key:
The purpose of this visualization is to explore how musical key influences various song attributes. By presenting an interactive bar chart, we can examine the average values of attributes like duration, danceability, energy, and popularity across different keys. This dynamic approach allows us to quickly identify patterns such as which keys are associated with more energetic tracks or higher popularity. Dividing the data by key offers insights into how tonality may shape musical style/ listener preferences.
