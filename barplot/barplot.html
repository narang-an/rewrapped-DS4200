            The bar chart displays the distribution of songs across musical
            keys, categorized by mode (major or minor). The musical keys are
            represented along the x-axis, while the y-axis shows the number of
            songs in each key. The bars are stacked to show the breakdown
            between major and minor modes, with the blue portion representing
            major and the red portion representing minor. Major keys are
            generally associated with more upbeat, energetic, and positive
            music, which is reflected in the higher number of songs in keys like
            A and G♯/A♭. On the other hand, minor keys tend to convey a more
            melancholic, sad, or introspective tone, as seen in keys like A♯/B♭
            and D# / E♭, where the minor mode dominates. Overall, while major
            keys are more prevalent in this dataset, the minor keys still make
            up a significant portion, highlighting the diversity of emotional
            expression in music across different keys.
