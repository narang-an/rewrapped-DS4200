                    The bar chart displays the distribution of songs across musical keys, categorized by mode (major or minor). 
                    Each key is represented numerically from 0 to 11, corresponding to the 12 chromatic scale pitches: 
                    0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, 3 = D♯/E♭, 4 = E, 5 = F, 6 = F♯/G♭, 7 = G, 8 = G♯/A♭, 9 = A, 10 = A♯/B♭, and 11 = B. 
                    These values denote the root note of each key, and the chart reflects how frequently songs occur in each key-mode pairing.

                    Keys 0 (C), 1 (C♯/D♭), and 8 (G♯/A♭) each feature 13 songs, the highest among all keys, though their mode distributions 
                    differ significantly. Keys 0 and 8 favor the major key, while key 1 is nearly balanced (7 major, 6 minor). Key 6 (F♯/G♭) 
                    is the only other with a near-even split (5 major, 6 minor). Most keys  show a clear preference for major mode, especially 
                    2 (D), 7 (G), and 8 (G♯/A♭). Keys 5 and 10 are two of the few keys that favor minor. Overall, major keys dominate, but 
                    minor keys remain a significant and stylistically relevant component of the dataset.
